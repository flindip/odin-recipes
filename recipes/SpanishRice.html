    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 onions, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained (Optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring chicken broth and tomato sauce to a boil in a small saucepan, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium
            and maintain a simmer while preparing the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
            browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving bacon grease in the
            skillet. Chop bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir onion in reserved bacon grease over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice;
            cook and stir until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour boiling chicken broth and tomato sauce into rice
            mixture; add diced tomatoes, green peppers, and chopped bacon. Season with chili powder, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir corn into rice mixture
            before serving</li>

    </ol>
